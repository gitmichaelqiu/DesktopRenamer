**DesktopRenamer** is a macOS menubar app that shows your **customized** name of the current desktop.

## üì¶ Installation

You do **NOT** have to disable *SIP* or things like that. Your macOS must be at least **macOS 13.0 Ventura**. All you need to do is:

1. Download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/DesktopRenamer/releases/)
2. Drag the app to the *Applications* folder
3. All set!

Because I do **NOT** have an Apple developer account, you may receive alerts such as "App is broken". To resolve this, you need to go to *terminal* and run the following command:

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DesktopRenamer.app
```

You may be required to enter the password. When you are entering the password, the password is not shown. This is required by Apple. The app will **NOT** steal your password or personal information.

## üí° Tips

The app will not work as expected when you connect to **multiple** displays. I am currently working on solving this. If you have any ideas, you are welcomed to post them in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/DesktopRenamer/issues).
