DesktopRenamer is a macOS menubar app that shows your **customized** name of the current desktop.

***DesktopLabelWindow** will be shown when entering Mission Control*

## Easy to Install

You do **NOT** have to disable *SIP* or things like that. All you need to do is:

1. Download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/DesktopRenamer/releases/)
2. Drag the app to the *Applications* folder
3. All set!

Because I do not have an Apple developer account, you may receive alerts such as "App is broken". To resolve this, you need to go to *terminal* and run the following command:

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DesktopRenamer.app
```

You may be required to enter the password. This is required by Apple. This app will **NOT** steal your password or personal information.
