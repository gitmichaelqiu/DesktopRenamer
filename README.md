**DesktopRenamer** is a macOS menubar app that shows your **customized** name of the current desktop.

## 📦 Installation

You do **NOT** have to disable *SIP* or things like that. Your macOS must be at least **macOS 13.0 Ventura**. All you need to do is:

1. Download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/DesktopRenamer/releases/)
2. Drag the app to the *Applications* folder
3. All set!

Because I do **NOT** have an Apple developer account for the app releases ~~(Apple charges an annual fee for this)~~, you may receive alerts such as "App is broken".

To resolve this, go to System Settings → the bottom of Privacy & Security → Open DesktopRenamer.

## 💡 Tips

The app will not work as expected when you connect to **multiple** displays. I am currently working on solving this. If you have any ideas, you are welcomed to post them in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gitmichaelqiu/DesktopRenamer/issues).
